# Project Abstract
Graphnet is a Javascript graph library that is created as a module for the semantic UI framework. Whereas Graphnet dynamically renders all nodes and edges via websocket connections, node and edge positioning algorithms such as force, random, circular, and others are provided within the Graphnet as builtin modules.

# What Covered
- Implemented Circle positioning algorithm.
- Implemented Force positioning algorithm and derived relevant formula for corresponding physical force.
- Restructured the code according to the function and placed them in their relevant module.
- Created the basic graph with nodes and edges and rendered using Canvas API.

# What left
- Rendering of nodes and edges in graph with web socket connection.
- Converting the Graph into an npm module.
